# Instructions for fixing the bridge server error

If you're running into the "dashboard_ws() missing 1 required positional argument: 'path'" error with Python 3.11, follow these steps:

1. First, stop any running bridge_server.py processes:
   ```
   pkill -f bridge_server.py
   ```

2. Check the websockets package version:
   ```
   pip show websockets
   ```
   
3. Use the new bridge_server_new.py file I created:
   ```
   chmod +x bridge_server_new.py
   python3 bridge_server_new.py
   ```

This new file includes:
- Enhanced error handling with more detailed logs
- Proper Python 3.11 compatibility
- The correct websocket handler signature that includes both parameters

If you still have issues:
1. Make sure you're using Python 3.11 to run both files
2. Check if there are any other versions of the bridge_server in different directories
3. Ensure your dashboard.py is connecting to the right host and port

For reference:
- The websockets API in Python 3.11 requires handlers to accept both 'websocket' and 'path' parameters
- The `asyncio.get_event_loop()` approach is deprecated in newer Python versions
